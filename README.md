# slot-reels-demo
A work in progress. I'm trying to work out how to simulate a proper slot spin in tkinter, I need help!
![Alt Text](https://github.com/Steve-Shambles/slot-reels-demo/blob/main/screebshot1.png)
I have one line of 5 reels and can smoothly move in 5 new symbols and move off the previous symbols, but that is as far I could get with the help of chatgtp4. I'm not sure if it's bad prompting on my part or chatgpt just doesn't get what spinning reels are, but when I ask for 3 lines of 5 symbols and give it specific ways of animating the symbols it goes into LSD trip territory with the code. I have done everythinbg I can to improve on chats original code but I don't understand some lines, dictionaries always throw me.
I would appreciate any help to get this looking and working a bit more like a real on-libe slot.
